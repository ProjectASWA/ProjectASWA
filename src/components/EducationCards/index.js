            Children Learning Center (CLC)

          <p className="card-description">
            CLC started as a pandemic pet project in October 2020, for the
            children of the Ram Nagar Slum of Shadnagar. It served the purpose
            of an after-school learning center so that children did not lose the
            flow of schooling & education post-pandemic. Presently, CLC helps in
            engaging children even when school is not running, prevents
            dropouts, generates curiosity in children, and facilitates their
            learning process. At CLC, we encourage them to express their ideas
            and thoughts and learn the language using stories, rhymes, games,
            drawing, and other activities. We teach them language and literacy
            using their day-to-day life experiences. Around60+ children are
            benefiting from this.
