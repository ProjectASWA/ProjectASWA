          We dedicate time every month to spreading happiness and joy to those
          in society who are abandoned and uncared for, including kids and
          elderly individuals. Through visits to orphanages and old-age homes,
          we share our love and support, fostering a sense of belonging and
          well-being. Our initiative, born out of a deep belief in the
          importance of sharing love and care, has impacted over 150 homes in
          the past decade. Each visit is filled with emotions, reinforcing our
          commitment to making a positive difference in the lives of those who
          need it most.

          Every visit is filled with emotions and sentiments. Each visit makes
          every volunteer very happy and makes them realize that sharing love
          with society is their duty. Share & Care is significant for us, as
          it’s the activity that led us to the formation of ASWA. In the past 10
          years, we have visited more than 150 homes.
